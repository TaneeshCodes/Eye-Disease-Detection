It is a common sign of 'wet' age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n\n**Common Treatment:** Anti-VEGF injections are the standard of care to stop vessel growth and reduce leakage."

This leads to swelling and blurred, washed-out vision.\n\n**Common Treatment:** Treatments include Anti-VEGF injections, laser therapy, and corticosteroid implants to reduce swelling."
    drusen = "### üü° Drusen\n\n**Description:** Drusen are small, yellow deposits of lipids and proteins that build up under the retina. While a few small drusen are normal with aging, large or numerous drusen are a key sign of early-stage age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n\n**Common Treatment:** No specific treatment for drusen, but monitoring is crucial. Lifestyle changes (e.g., specific vitamins (AREDS2), quitting smoking, healthy diet) may slow the progression to advanced AMD."
