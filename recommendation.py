### ðŸ©º Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)

**What it is:** CNV is the growth of abnormal, leaky blood vessels under the retina. This leakage can cause fluid and blood to accumulate, leading to rapid and severe vision loss. It is the hallmark of "wet" age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

**Common Symptoms:**
- Sudden or gradual onset of blurry or distorted vision (e.g., straight lines appearing wavy).
- A dark or blind spot in the central vision.

**Common Treatment:**
The most common treatment is **Anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) therapy**. These are injections into the eye that help stop the growth of new blood vessels and reduce leakage.

dme = """
### ðŸ©º Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)

**What it is:** DME is a complication of diabetes. High blood sugar levels damage blood vessels in the retina, causing them to leak fluid into the macula (the part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision). This fluid causes the macula to swell, leading to blurred vision.

**Common Symptoms:**
- Blurry or wavy central vision.
- Colors appearing washed out or faded.

**Common Treatment:**
Treatment aims to reduce the swelling and includes **Anti-VEGF injections**, laser therapy to seal leaky vessels, and corticosteroid (steroid) injections or implants.

drusen = """
### ðŸŸ¡ Drusen

**What it is:** Drusen are small, yellow deposits of lipids (fats) and proteins that build up under the retina. They are a common sign of aging.

- **Small drusen** are very common and usually don't cause vision problems.
- **Large drusen** are a key early sign of **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**. They can increase the risk of progressing to advanced AMD (either "wet" CNV or "dry" geographic atrophy).

**Common Symptoms:**
- Often, there are no symptoms in the early stages.
- May cause some blurry or dim vision as they grow in size or number.

**Common Treatment:**
There is no specific treatment to remove drusen. Management focuses on:
- **Regular monitoring** by an eye care professional.
- **Lifestyle changes:** Quitting smoking, eating a diet rich in leafy greens, and wearing UV protection.
- **AREDS2 vitamins:** A specific supplement formula that can help slow the progression of intermediate AMD.

### âœ… Normal Retina

**What it is:** This OCT scan shows a healthy, normal retina.

- The **foveal contour** (the small pit in the center of the macula) has a normal shape.
- The retinal layers are distinct, clear, and show no signs of fluid, swelling (edema), or abnormal deposits (like drusen).
- The thickness of the retina is within the normal range.

**Action:**
No immediate medical action is required. This scan indicates a healthy macula. It's important to continue with regular, routine eye check-ups as recommended by your specialist to monitor your long-term eye health.
